/*
The Vent-display project is a ventilator display that consumes PIRDS data and
performs most clinical respiration calculations. This is an important part of
Public Invention's goal of creating an open-source ventilator ecosystem. This
is a stand-alone .html file with about a thousand lines of JavaScript that
implements a clinical display that doctors want to see of an operating
ventilator. It includes live data trace plots of pressure and flow, as well as
calculated values such as tidal volume.
