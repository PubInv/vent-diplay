# Vent Display
A Ventilator Display that consumes PIRDS data and performs most clinical respiration calculations

This is an important part of the Public Invention's goal of creating an opens source ventilator ecosystem.
This is a stand-alone .html file with about a thousand lines of JavaScript that implements a clinical display
that doctors want to see of an operting ventilator. It includes live data trace plots of pressure and flow, as
well as calculated values such as tidal volume.

You can see the vent-display from our [public data lake](http://ventmon.coslabs.com/), where you 
can find both live and [static](http://ventmon.coslabs.com/breath_plot?i=71.245.238.32.test_file_name.20200612135337) displays.

For a hands on demonstration of Vent Display and in-depth explanation of VentMon watch our screen cast (demonstration of Vent Display occurrs at 10:56).

# Volunteer Needed

This is a project with a rich set of features that need to be added involving respiration calculations. 
Additionally, there are GUI features such as as the ability to scroll back in time that need to be added. Please contact <read.robert@gmail.com> if you would like to volunteer.
